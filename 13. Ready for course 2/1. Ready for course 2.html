These courses use the same method found in the 3 Minute French courses, but they focus on building fluency by looking at the different structures of the French language. I recommend starting these courses once you’ve completed up to 3 Minute French – Course 3, and then you can work through both series simultaneously. Here are the links for the Building Structures in French courses on Udemy:</p><p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/building-structures-in-french-structure-1/?couponCode=3MINUTEMAY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Building Structures in French – Structure 1</a></p><p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/building-structures-in-french-structure-2/?couponCode=3MINUTEMAY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Building Structures in French – Structure 2</a></p><p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/building-structures-in-french-structure-3/?couponCode=3MINUTEMAY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Building Structures in French – Structure 3</a></p><p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/building-structures-in-french-structure-4/?couponCode=3MINUTEMAY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Building Structures in French – Structure 4</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>FRENCH GRAMMAR</strong></p><p>Finally, if you want to explore the French language even further, I have some French grammar courses available. I’ve used the same method in these courses as I have in the other courses, so hopefully you’ll find them fun and interesting</p><p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/french-grammar-quick-guide-verbs-1/?couponCode=3MINUTEMAY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">French Grammar – Quick Guide – Verbs 1</a></p><p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/success-in-french-grammar-the-present-perfect-tense/?couponCode=3MINUTEMAY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Success in French Grammar – The Past Tense (aka the present perfect)</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>MORE LANGUAGES</strong></p><p>If you would like to learn a different language, I have the same courses above available in Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese and Dutch.
