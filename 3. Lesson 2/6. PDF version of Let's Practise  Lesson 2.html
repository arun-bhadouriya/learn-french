<p>Some people have asked if they could have a PDF&nbsp;version of the questions in the "Let's Practise" sections of the course. They gave the great suggestion that they could either print off the PDF or download it to their phones or tablets and get a family member or friend to test them by asking them to translate the English sentences and then checking if they were right.</p><p>Well, ask and you shall receive... Here is the PDF for this lesson.</p><p>Merci :-)</p>
